See the [Scientific Python Developer Guide][spc-dev-intro] for a detailed
description of best practices for developing scientific packages.

# Quick development

Start development with nox, which `uvx nox` runs without installing and
`uv tool install nox` installs. To get uv itself,
[install it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) with pip,
pipx, brew, or the single-file binary.

To use, run `nox`. It runs the linters and tests on every installed version of
Python on your system, skipping ones that are not installed. You can also run
specific jobs:

```console
$ nox -s lint  # Lint only
$ nox -s tests  # Python tests
$ nox -s docs  # Build and serve the docs
$ nox -s build  # Make an SDist and wheel
```

Nox handles everything for you, including setting up a temporary virtual
environment for each run.

# Setting up a development environment manually

You can set up a development environment by running:

```bash
uv sync
```

# Pre-commit

You should prepare pre-commit or prek, which will help you by checking that
commits pass required checks:

```bash
uv tool install pre-commit # or brew install pre-commit on macOS
pre-commit install # Will install a pre-commit hook into the git repo
```

You can also/alternatively run `pre-commit run` (changes only) or
`pre-commit run --all-files` to check even without installing the hook.

# Testing

Use pytest to run the unit checks:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

# Coverage

Use pytest-cov to generate coverage reports:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=orderbooks
```

# Building docs

You can build and serve the docs using:

```bash
nox -s docs
```

You can build the docs only with:

```bash
nox -s docs --non-interactive
```
